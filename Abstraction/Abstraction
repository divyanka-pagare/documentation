Abstraction →

Abstraction means hiding implementation details from the user.

In Java, abstraction is achieved through both abstract classes and interfaces.
Since you now have the option to choose between them, you must understand when to use which one.
Let’s look at the difference between abstract classes and interfaces in Java.

Abstract Class → Provides partial abstraction

Interface → Helps achieve complete abstraction


Difference Between Abstract Class and Interface

| Parameter            | Abstract Class                                                                  | Interface                                                                                       |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Definition           | A class typically designed to be a parent class. Other classes inherit from it. | A blueprint of a class consisting of abstract methods describing actions an object can perform. |
| Declaration          | Declared using the keyword `abstract`.                                          | Declared using the keyword `interface`.                                                         |
| Implementation       | Can provide implementation details.                                             | Cannot provide implementation details (before Java 8).                                          |
| Inheritance          | Inherited using the keyword `extends`.                                          | Implemented using the keyword `implements`.                                                     |
| Multiple Inheritance | Does not support multiple inheritance.                                          | Supports multiple inheritance.                                                                  |
| Types of Methods     | Can have both abstract and non-abstract methods.                                | Can have only abstract methods (before Java 8).                                                 |
| Types of Variables   | Can include final, non-final, static, and non-static variables.                 | Can include only static and final variables.                                                    |
| Example              | `java\npublic abstract class Language {\n    public abstract void java();\n}`   | `java\npublic interface Language {\n    void java();\n}`                                        |


Key Differences Between Abstract Classes and Interfaces in Java

1. Abstract classes can have both abstract and non-abstract methods, while interfaces can only have abstract methods.

2. Abstract classes can contain instance variables, whereas interfaces cannot.

3. A class can extend only one abstract class, but it can implement multiple interfaces.

4. An abstract class can provide partial implementation, while an interface requires full implementation in the implementing class.

5. Abstract classes can have constructors; interfaces cannot.

6. An abstract class provides a common base for a group of related classes, while an interface defines a set of methods a class must implement.

7. Use an abstract class when multiple related classes need shared behavior.
Use an interface when you simply want to define a set of behaviors that any class should implement.
